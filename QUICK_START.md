## üìã What You Need

- **Instagram Account**: Your own account for the bot to use
- **Target Account**: The account whose followers you want to follow
- **Google Chrome**: The bot uses Chrome for automation
- **Python 3.7+**: Make sure you have Python installed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This is for **educational purposes only**
- Use at your own risk
- Instagram may detect and ban automated activity
- Start with small numbers (10-20 follows per session)
- Use longer delays between actions (5-10 seconds)

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you get errors:

1. **"Chrome driver not found"**: The bot will download it automatically
2. **"Login failed"**: Check your credentials in config.env
3. **"Element not found"**: Instagram's UI may have changed
4. **"Rate limited"**: Reduce MAX_FOLLOWS_PER_SESSION and increase delays

## üìä Monitoring

- Check console output for real-time progress
- View detailed logs in `instagram_bot.log`
- The bot will show you exactly what it's doing

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Tips

- Don't run the bot too frequently
- Use realistic delays between actions
- Monitor your account for any warnings
- Stop immediately if you get any Instagram warnings
