```

### 4. Edit Configuration
Edit `config.env` with your credentials:
```env
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_instagram_username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_instagram_password
TARGET_ACCOUNT=target_account_username
MAX_FOLLOWS_PER_SESSION=50
DELAY_BETWEEN_ACTIONS=3
DELAY_BETWEEN_SESSIONS=3600
```

### 5. Test Setup

# Windows
python test_setup.py

# Linux/macOS
python3 test_setup.py
```

## Configuration Options

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|

| `INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD` | Your Instagram password | Required |
| `TARGET_ACCOUNT` | Target account username | Required |
| `MAX_FOLLOWS_PER_SESSION` | Maximum follows per session | 50 |
| `DELAY_BETWEEN_ACTIONS` | Delay between actions (seconds) | 3 |
| `DELAY_BETWEEN_SESSIONS` | Delay between sessions (seconds) | 3600 |

## Usage

## How It Works

1. **Login**: The bot logs into your Instagram account using Selenium
2. **Extract Followers**: Navigates to the target account and extracts their followers
3. **Follow Users**: Systematically follows each follower with random delays
4. **Safety Measures**: Includes various anti-detection features

## Safety Features

- **Random Delays**: Simulates human behavior with random timing
- **User Agent Spoofing**: Uses realistic browser user agent
- **Anti-Detection**: Removes automation indicators
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits to avoid being flagged
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of various Instagram UI changes
- **Multiple Selectors**: Robust element detection with fallback strategies

## Logging

The bot creates detailed logs in `instagram_bot.log` including:
- Login attempts and results
- Follower extraction progress
- Follow actions and results
- Errors and exceptions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Failed**
   - Check your credentials in config.env
   - Ensure your Instagram account is not locked
   - Try logging in manually first

2. **Chrome Driver Issues**
   - The bot automatically downloads the correct Chrome driver
   - Make sure Chrome browser is installed
   - Update Chrome to the latest version

3. **Element Not Found**
   - Instagram's UI may have changed
   - Check the logs for specific error messages
   - The bot includes fallback selectors

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Reduce `MAX_FOLLOWS_PER_SESSION`
   - Increase `DELAY_BETWEEN_ACTIONS`
   - Wait longer between sessions

5. **Windows-Specific Issues**
   - Run Command Prompt as Administrator if needed
   - Ensure Python is added to PATH during installation
   - Use `python` instead of `python3` on Windows

6. **Linux-Specific Issues (Kali Linux)**
   - Use `--break-system-packages` flag with pip
   - Install system packages: `sudo apt install python3-selenium python3-requests python3-bs4 python3-lxml python3-dotenv`
   - Install webdriver-manager: `pip install webdriver-manager --break-system-packages`

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the log file for detailed error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Verify your Instagram credentials
4. Make sure the target account is public or you're following it
5. Run `python3 test_setup.py` to verify your setup
